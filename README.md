## Introduction:
In today's competitive market, running a campaign is easy, but making it effective takes insight.
This project analyzes marketing data to uncover what truly drives customer response. I explored metrics like Web visits, Web purchase rates, Campaign success, and Customer profiles.


The goal is to understand which strategies resonate and where engagement falls flat.
Power BI was used to bring the numbers to life with clear, interactive visuals. Each chart reveals patterns that help sharpen targeting and improve performance. From campaign response rates to web conversion trends, the data tells a story.
These insights are valuable for refining marketing efforts and reaching the right audience.
At its core, this project is about making smarter, customer-focused decisions. Because behind every successful campaign is a deep understanding of who you're talking to.

1. Average Retention Rate 
2. Average Churn Rate
3. Comparison of purchase channels
4. MoM Customer Acquisition

### Overview:

### Analysis:

### Average Churn Rate

Churn significantly improved from 2012 to 2013, dropping by over 2%, indicating effective early retention strategies. However, a slight rise in 2014 to 8.44% signals that churn is creeping back up.
This trend shows that while initial retention tactics worked, their long-term impact is fading, possibly due to lack of follow-up engagement or evolving customer expectations.

### Web purchases % of Web activity
Web purchase rates are consistently above 42%, showing that online channels have become an integral part of the customer journey. Peak digital activity was observed in Jan, April, and May, which aligns with the campaign conversion rate peak trend. Slight fluctuation in annual web activity shows stabilization, not growth, in digital engagement.

### Customer Acquisition
There was a remarkable surge in customer acquisition in 2013, doubling 2012's figure. However, this momentum was not sustained, as acquisitions dropped by 44% in 2014. The inconsistency signals a possible lapse in campaign efficiency or market saturation post-2013.

### Total Customer Spending
Spending peaked in 2013 with $715k total spending, nearly doubling from 2012, where total spending was $368k, before dropping sharply in 2014 to $273k.
This trend correlates with the spike in customer acquisition in 2013, suggesting that higher customer acquisition translated directly into greater revenue that year.
The decline in 2014 spending reflects both reduced customer acquisition which resulted in lower spending.

### Campaign Conversion Rate
The campaign conversion rate was 0.29 in 2012, 0.28 in 2013, and increased to 0.33 in 2014. While there was a slight dip in 2013, the improvement in 2014 suggests a more effective approach to targeting, messaging, or offer timing.

### Sum Of Complaint 
The total number of customer complaints was 6 in 2012, doubled to 12 in 2013, and then dropped significantly to 3 in 2014. This trend suggests a notable improvement in customer experience or issue resolution practices in 2014.

### Campaign Conversion Rate by Country

The campaign conversion rate was highest in the USA at 0.40%, followed by Spain (0.38%), Germany (0.36%), and Canada (0.35%). This indicates that marketing efforts resonated most strongly with the U.S. audience, with Spain and Germany also showing solid engagement.

### Customer Spending by Marital Status
The analysis reveals that married customers account for the highest total spending at $510,453, followed by those who are living together ($352,865) and single individuals ($291,112). Lower spending levels were recorded among widowed, alone, and "YOLO" category customers.

## Conclusion
Overall, the data shows solid progress, especially in 2014, with better campaign conversion rates and fewer complaints. Married and cohabiting customers are spending the most, highlighting a key audience to focus on.

That said, there’s still room to grow. Since married and cohabiting customers are spending the most, campaigns could be tailored more toward these groups to maximize impact. Also, countries like the U.S. clearly responded better to campaigns, so it’s worth digging into what worked there and applying it elsewhere.
In summary, things are moving in the right direction. The focus now should be on scaling what works, refining strategies by region, and building stronger connections with top-value customers.
### Recommendation
- The company should reinforce customer retention with personalized communications, loyalty rewards, and post-campaign satisfaction tracking.
- The company should further boost web sales via targeted email campaigns, mobile optimization, abandoned cart recovery, and exclusive online offers.
- They should also reintroduce or revamp successful strategies from 2013 to revive acquisition growth.
- The sharp decline in 2014 complaints should be studied to identify the key changes that led to better customer satisfaction, such as improved communication, faster support, or product adjustments. These practices should be documented and standardized to maintain low complaint levels going forward.
- Future campaigns by the company should leverage strategies that proved effective in the U.S. market, such as message tone, timing, and channel use, and adapt them for other regions. 
- Marketing strategies should prioritize married and cohabiting customers, as they represent the most valuable segments in terms of spending. Tailored offers, loyalty programs, and family-oriented campaigns could further boost engagement and spending within these groups. Additionally, the company should explore the lower-spending segments to understand barriers and potential growth opportunities.
